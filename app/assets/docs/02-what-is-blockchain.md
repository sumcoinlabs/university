# 2. What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions on a distributed network of computers. Ever since the initial launch of Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain technology has proliferated throughout the world in many different forms. This new and exciting technology has the potential to impact society in innumerable ways. In this section we will explain what a blockchain really is, how it functions and its core purpose.

At its core, a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be modified without modifying all subsequent blocks, making it an immutable record of all transactions that have occurred on the network.

The primary purpose of a blockchain is to provide a secure and transparent way to record and verify transactions. This is achieved through a distributed network of computers that collectively validate and approve transactions before they are added to the blockchain. This network is made up of nodes, or individual computers, that work together to ensure the integrity of the network. By eliminating the need for a central authority or intermediary, blockchains allow for secure, peer-to-peer transactions that are resistant to tampering or censorship. As a result, blockchains have the potential to revolutionize the way we do business, transfer assets, and interact with one another.

## Centralized Private Ledgers

At the heart of Sumcoin lies a decentralized public ledger, also known as a blockchain. Simply put, a ledger is a record-keeping system that documents transactions, such as debits, credits, and balances, which traditionally took the form of physical documents, such as spreadsheets. These records are used to keep track of an individual's or organization's financial standing or any other recordable data, such as assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and capital.

Before blockchain technology, it was common practice for individuals to trust their financial accounts to third-party organizations, such as banks, credit card issuers, money transfer services, and other financial institutions. These centralized services, run by fallible humans, held private ledgers of customer data, which were not routinely shared with the public for independent verification. In this outdated model, customers were left with no choice but to trust that the organizations managing their financial accounts were truthful and accurate.

This system was flawed as it lacked transparency and accountability, thereby exposing customers to the risk of errors, unaccountability, fraud, and corruption. The customer had to trust blindly, without the ability to verify, which could lead to unfavorable consequences.

By introducing a public blockchain, Sumcoin offers a transparent and decentralized system that eliminates the need for trust in a third-party organization. Every transaction is publicly recorded on the blockchain, making it immutable and easily auditable. This feature makes Sumcoin more secure, transparent and accountable, which makes it an attractive asset to own.

## Distributed Public Ledgers

Blockchain technology represents a significant shift in the way financial transactions are processed and managed. Unlike the traditional centralized model of record keeping, where individuals have to trust a single entity, the blockchain introduces a shared public ledger that is distributed globally among a large group of people. Validators, the individuals responsible for maintaining the blockchain network, work together to validate transactions initiated by users.

Each validator hosts a full copy of the public ledger and operates a node, a program that verifies incoming transactions and relays them to other validators. The validators form a network of nodes that work to secure the blockchain by protecting against fraud. Transactions are broadcast across this network and validated or rejected based on their legitimacy. This distributed trust model replaces the need for a centralized authority, which can be prone to errors, corruption and fraud.

In contrast to traditional financial systems, the blockchain introduces a level of transparency and oversight that is not possible with centralized ledgers. This distributed approach to trust allows each validator to independently verify the integrity of the ledger, ensuring that the public ledger remains a true representation of the network's state. The blockchain's open and transparent nature ensures that every transaction is validated and recorded in a way that is tamper-proof, immutable and resistant to fraud.

## The Blockchain

The blockchain is a revolutionary technology that has transformed the way people think about financial transactions. At its core, the blockchain is a continuously growing list of individual transaction records called blocks. When combined together, these blocks form the entirety of the public ledger, which consists of all the transactions that have ever taken place on the network. This decentralized and transparent approach to record-keeping has enormous implications for industries beyond finance, including supply chain management, voting systems, and data storage.

With Sumcoin, a new block is added to the chain about every thirty (30) seconds, which is much faster than the ten (10) minute time frame of Bitcoin. This rapid speed allows Sumcoin to handle massive amounts of transactions with ease. In fact, Sumcoin's architecture has the capacity to handle more than 400 times the transaction throughput of Bitcoin. This makes it an ideal choice for businesses and individuals who require quick and efficient transactions.

The public ledger, maintained by a global network of nodes, ensures that account balances are consistently and automatically updated with each new added block to reflect changes from these transactions. This distributed approach eliminates the need for intermediaries and provides users with greater control over their finances. Additionally, Sumcoin uses proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, which consumes significantly less energy compared to the proof-of-work algorithm used by Bitcoin. This makes Sumcoin an environmentally-friendly choice for those who are concerned about the impact of cryptocurrency on the planet.

## Distributed Consensus Protocol

Distributed consensus protocol is an essential aspect of the blockchain's design that has revolutionized the way trust is distributed in decentralized networks. The protocol is responsible for ensuring that each transaction or block added to the blockchain is validated, verified, and agreed upon by the network's many validators. In essence, it replaces the need for a centralized authority figure with a community of validators working together to achieve majority agreement on the validity of the network's public ledger. This automated process provides a high degree of transparency and trust, making it a fundamental feature of blockchain technology.

The distributed consensus protocol has numerous benefits that make it a critical component of the blockchain. One of its key advantages is its resilience to hacking attempts, corruption, and fraudulent activities. As the protocol relies on a distributed network of validators, any attempt to corrupt the public ledger would require the attacker to compromise a majority of the validators, which is incredibly difficult to achieve. Furthermore, the protocol is designed to function without the need for trust between participants, which enables secure transactions to take place in a completely trustless environment. This not only increases security but also eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, making the entire system more efficient and cost-effective.

**Automated:** The automation of the consensus and verification process in blockchain provides a high level of security to the network. Unlike traditional financial systems where transactions have to be manually processed and validated, the use of blockchain code eliminates the possibility of human error or fraud. In addition, automation allows for a faster and more efficient transaction processing system.

When a user initiates a transaction on the blockchain network, the transaction is broadcasted to the network of validation nodes. The nodes then automatically validate the transaction using the consensus protocol and add it to the block if it is deemed valid. This process is seamless for the end user, who only has to wait for a short time for the transaction to be processed. The automation of the verification process also ensures that validators are incentivized to work honestly, as any attempt to manipulate the system can be detected and punished by the network. As a result, the use of blockchain and its automated verification process provides a level of trust and transparency that is unparalleled in traditional financial systems.

**Trustless:** Blockchain technology represents a fundamental shift in the way we trust systems. Unlike traditional centralized entities, which require trust in a single party, the blockchain is trustless, meaning that trust is not concentrated in any one central entity, but is instead distributed among the network's validators. This makes the blockchain a completely impartial and unbiased network that is transparent and verifiable by all parties. The trustless nature of the blockchain also makes it possible to create applications and services that were previously impossible or impractical, such as decentralized finance and digital identity management.

The trustlessness of the blockchain is not only beneficial for individual users, but also for businesses and governments. By removing the need for intermediaries and third-party institutions to manage transactions and other processes, the blockchain can significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency. Furthermore, the immutable and tamper-proof nature of the blockchain's ledger makes it ideal for applications that require high levels of security, such as supply chain management and voting systems. With its potential to revolutionize many different industries and transform the way we trust systems, the trustlessness of the blockchain represents a major breakthrough in the history of technology.

**Censorship Resistant:** Unlike a centrally managed entity that depends on user trust of authority figures who are capable of errors or intentional acts of fraud, Sumcoin's blockchain is designed with no such central point of failure. Instead, user trust is placed in Sumcoin's distributed consensus protocol, which is an automated process responsible for achieving majority agreement among the network's many validators on whether the public ledger can be considered valid or not. If the majority of validators working to secure the Sumcoin network can verify and agree that the public ledger is accurate and has not been tampered with, then it can be trusted as legitimate and held as absolute truth by all participants of the network.

Sumcoin's distributed consensus protocol, which runs on code, is responsible for how the Sumcoin blockchain functions as well as its process for validating transactions and blocks. This protocol is what gives Sumcoin its many beneficial qualities, including being completely trustless, transparent, verifiable, and censorship resistant. Since Sumcoin's protocol is completely automated, the consensus and verification process of the public ledger is carried out without the need for manual validation by security providers. From the standpoint of the end user, a submitted transaction is automatically processed by the Sumcoin network, while from the standpoint of the validator, transactions submitted by users of the Sumcoin network are automatically verified and accepted or rejected by the node software they are running. This means that Sumcoin users can trust that their data is guaranteed to be accurate and secure, without the need to trust any centralized authority or security provider. Plus, with a new block added to the Sumcoin chain about every thirty seconds, Sumcoin is much faster and able to handle massive amounts of transactions compared to other blockchains like Bitcoin.

**Immutable:** One of the most compelling features of Sumcoin's blockchain is its security. The Sumcoin blockchain is highly secure and immutable, meaning that once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it can never be altered or deleted. This is because the Sumcoin blockchain uses advanced cryptographic techniques that ensure the integrity of the data stored on the network. This high level of security provides Sumcoin users with peace of mind, knowing that their transactions are protected from any external threats, including cyber attackers and malicious governments. Sumcoin has created a secure and trustworthy platform for digital transactions that is trusted by users around the world.
