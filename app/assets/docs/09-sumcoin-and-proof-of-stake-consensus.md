# 9. Sumcoin & Proof-of-Stake Consensus

Sumcoin is a groundbreaking alternative to traditional proof-of-work blockchains, utilizing an innovative consensus protocol with Index Pricing that was developed by Sumtoshi and first introduced to the market in 2018. In 2023, Sumcoin transitioned to an all proof-of-stake blockchain, which means that instead of relying on computational power, it's the coin owners who wield influence over the network, produce new blocks, and secure the chain. This new consensus mechanism greatly reduces the energy consumption of the network and makes it more accessible to a wider range of users. As a result, all Sumcoin holders are effectively co-owners of the network, which helps to decentralize power and make the blockchain more resilient against attacks.

## Time as an Alternative Scarce Resource

Sumcoin's innovative consensus protocol operates under a unique paradigm that employs time as a scarce resource. Unlike traditional proof-of-work blockchains that consume immense amounts of energy, Sumcoin’s proof-of-stake system uses a minter's coin age to select the next block producer. The longer a minter has held their coins in their wallet, the higher their coin age, and the more likely they are to be selected to produce the next block. By prioritizing coin age instead of computational work, Sumcoin offers a more energy-efficient and sustainable way to maintain the network’s security.

Through this system, Sumcoin ensures that all coin owners have an equal chance to earn block rewards and secure the network, as everyone has the potential to increase their coin age over time. This means that all Sumcoin owners can potentially participate in the network's decision-making process and earn block rewards. With no barriers to entry, everyone has an equal chance to participate in the network, making Sumcoin's protocol more inclusive and decentralized.

In summary, Sumcoin's protocol represents a more environmentally friendly, fair, and inclusive alternative to traditional proof-of-work blockchains. By prioritizing time as a scarce resource and emphasizing equal opportunity, Sumcoin offers a more sustainable and secure way to maintain its network.

## Time Based Rules & Restrictions

In Sumcoin, the process of block production is governed by time-based rules and restrictions to ensure fairness and prevent a single minter from dominating the process. The protocol requires minters to hold coins in their wallet for at least 1 day before they become eligible to compete in the process of producing new blocks. Once a new block is minted, the coins used in the process are automatically sent back to the minter. This causes the age of the coins to reset to zero, and the minter needs to wait another day to be eligible for block production again.

These rules prevent a minter from consistently producing blocks one after another, which would result in a monopoly on block generation. Furthermore, a minter's probability of finding a new block reaches its maximum after 90 days, at which point their stake reaches maturity. This ensures that no minter can hold a monopoly on the block generation process for an extended period of time.

By using time as a limited resource, Sumcoin's protocol is designed to make the process of block generation fair and democratic. Minters with high coin age do have an advantage, but the rules ensure that they cannot dominate the process for long periods of time. As a result, all coin owners of Sumcoin have an equal opportunity to participate in the minting process and help secure the network.

## Majority Attacks are Cost Prohibitive

In Sumcoin, proof-of-stake is used to generate new blocks and secure the network against malicious attacks. This protocol also makes Sumcoin much less vulnerable to double-spend attacks, since a bad actor would need to own the majority of the total coin age of all coins participating in the minting process. Since most coins are held in personal wallets, an attacker would need to make a significant investment to acquire enough coins to launch such an attack.

In order to pull off a double spend attack on Sumcoin, a malicious actor would have to buy a large amount of coins from the market. This massive purchase would be extremely costly and likely bankrupt the attacker.  The range of affordability would make it an unprofitable venture for the attacker. Furthermore, the attacker would likely run out of funds before being able to acquire the necessary number of coins.

In comparison to proof-of-work blockchains, attempting to purchase more than half of the coins needed for minting in circulation on Sumcoin is more cost-prohibitive than attempting to acquire a majority of the hashing power. Thus, the proof-of-stake protocol used by Sumcoin makes the network much more secure and provides a powerful deterrent against potential malicious attacks.

## Attackers are Financially Tied to the Network

Despite the theoretical possibility of a successful double spend attack, it is not a feasible option for attackers in Sumcoin. This is because the attackers would have to invest a significant amount of funds into Sumcoin, and a successful attack would only end up damaging the attacker’s original investment.

Moreover, even if the double spender manages to cash out their massive number of coins after a successful attack, it does promise a trading party as the coins price is tied to the Index rate and only in the cases where SUM were listed on an exchange would theoretically only end up crashing the market price, causing them to lose more funds than they could ever hope to gain from the attack. As a result, a double spend attack in Sumcoin would not be profitable and is best avoided completely.

Unlike proof-of-work consensus, where attackers only need a majority of hashing power to launch a successful attack, in Sumcoin, attackers are financially tied to the network they are trying to attack through the coins they purchase. This unique aspect of the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism further reinforces the financial disincentive for attackers.

Overall, for an attack like this to make sense, the attacker would need to be completely willing to risk losing their entire financial investment in the network. Therefore, a double spend attack in Sumcoin would be counterproductive and not a viable option for attackers.
